# AI-powered Git Commit Function
# Copy paste this gist into your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to gain the `gcm` command. It:
# 1) gets the current staged changed diff
# 2) sends them to an LLM to write the git commit message
# 3) allows you to easily accept, edit, regenerate, cancel
# But - just read and edit the code however you like
# the `llm` CLI util is awesome, can get it here: https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/

gcm() {
    # Check if there are any staged changes
    if [ -z "$(git diff --cached --name-only)" ]; then
        echo "No staged changes found. Please stage your changes before committing."
        return 1
    fi

    # Function to generate commit message
    generate_commit_message() {
        git diff --cached | llm -m gpt-4o -s "
Write a short and concise commit message: Start with a summary in imperative mood, explain the 'why' behind changes, 
use bullet points for multiple changes. A single line is perfectly fine for small changes. Reply with JUST the commit 
message and nothing else. Your whole reply will be passed to git commit -m \"[message]\".

Below is a diff of all staged changes, coming from the command:

\`\`\`
git diff --cached
\`\`\`
"
